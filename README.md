## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+ and npm v7+
- CeloMΔIND backend API running and accessible
- Web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Browser extension wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.) for blockchain transactions

### Installation

```bash
# Clone both repositories
git clone https://github.com/0xOucan/celo-mind-dn.git
git clone https://github.com/0xOucan/celo-mind-web.git

# Use the launch script to start both services
cp celo-mind-dn/launch.sh ./
chmod +x launch.sh
./launch.sh
```

The launch script automatically:
1. Installs dependencies for both repositories
2. Starts the backend API server
3. Starts the frontend development server
4. Connects them together with proper configuration

### Configuration

The application requires the following environment variables:

```
# API endpoint for the CeloMΔIND backend
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000

# Celoscan explorer URL for transaction links
VITE_CELO_EXPLORER_URL=https://celoscan.io

# Privy App ID for wallet integration
VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=your_privy_app_id
```

## 🔌 Backend Integration

This web interface connects to the [CeloMΔIND backend API](https://github.com/0xOucan/celo-mind-dn) to process commands and execute blockchain operations.

### Communication Flow

1. **User Interface**: The web frontend collects user inputs through a conversational interface
2. **API Requests**: Frontend sends natural language commands to the `/api/agent/chat` endpoint
3. **AI Processing**: Backend processes commands using advanced AI and Agent Orchestration
4. **Blockchain Operations**: Backend creates transaction requests for the frontend wallet to sign
5. **Transaction Handling**: Frontend monitors and processes pending transactions with the connected wallet
6. **Response Handling**: Frontend displays results and updates wallet balances

### Wallet Integration

CeloMΔIND supports external wallets through the Privy integration:

- **Wallet Connection**: Connect any EIP-1193 compatible wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.)
- **Transaction Signing**: Transactions generated by the AI are sent to your wallet for signing
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Monitor transaction status in real-time through the UI
- **Wallet Balances**: View your wallet's token balances and total portfolio value
- **Network Switching**: Automatic Celo network detection and switching
- **Security**: No private keys stored in the application or backend

## 🧩 Key Components

### 1. WalletContext
The central wallet management system provides:
- Wallet connection state management
- Backend synchronization
- Address tracking and formatting
- Integration with Privy authentication

### 2. TransactionMonitor
Monitors and processes transactions by:
- Polling for pending transactions
- Creating wallet clients for signing
- Network validation and switching
- Transaction status tracking
- Error handling with helpful messages

### 3. WalletBalances
Real-time balance tracking with:
- Direct blockchain data fetching with viem
- USD conversion with market prices
- Visual indicators for token types
- One-click refresh functionality
- CeloScan integration for verification

### 4. ChatInterface
Intelligent conversation interface with:
- Message history tracking

- Pre-checks for wallet connection

## 🌐 Running the Complete Stack

For the best experience, run both the frontend and backend together:

```bash
# Start both servers using the launch script
./launch.sh
```

This will start:
- Backend API server at http://localhost:4000
- Frontend development server at http://localhost:5173

## 🚢 Proof-of-Ship Improvements

We've implemented all the major recommendations from the [Celo Proof-of-Ship report](https://github.com/celo-org/Proof-of-Ship/blob/main/2/reports/projects/CeloMind.md) to significantly enhance the security, code quality, and architecture of our application:

### Security Enhancements
- ✅ **Eliminated Private Key Storage**: Removed all private keys from .env files and implemented a secure wallet connection system that keeps keys in your browser wallet
- ✅ **Browser Extension Integration**: Integrated with browser wallets (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.) that handle transaction signing without exposing private keys
- ✅ **Network Validation**: Added automated network detection and Celo chain switching to ensure transactions always target the correct network
- ✅ **Transaction Monitoring**: Implemented real-time transaction monitoring with detailed status reporting and error recovery

- ✅ **Mock Services**: Created mock services for testing components in isolation
- ✅ **Error Case Tests**: Added specific tests for error conditions and edge cases

## 🔐 Security Considerations

The CeloMΔIND web interface implements several security best practices:

- **No Private Key Storage**: Private keys never leave your wallet - all transactions require explicit approval
- **Secure Wallet Connections**: Implemented via Privy integration with industry-standard security
- **Transaction Verification**: All transactions include clear information about what you're approving
- **Network Validation**: Automatic verification that you're connected to the Celo network before transactions
- **Session-Based Authentication**: Wallet connections persist only for the current session
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Complete visibility into all pending and processed transactions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents security issues from failed operations
- **Data Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing to prevent injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## 🔄 Transaction Handling

CeloMΔIND implements a robust transaction system:

1. **AI-Generated Transactions**: The AI agent creates transaction requests based on your commands
2. **Transaction Queue**: Transactions are queued for wallet signature
3. **Wallet Signing**: Your connected wallet receives the transaction for approval
4. **Status Monitoring**: Monitor transaction status in real-time in the UI
5. **Transaction History**: View completed and pending transactions
